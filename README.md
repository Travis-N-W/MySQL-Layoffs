## Brief Objective 

Carried out comprehensive data analysis on a dataset of worldwide company layoffs through MySQL and Power BI. The project involved data cleaning and preprocessing, including removing duplicate entries, standardizing date formats, converting text fields to appropriate data types, and resolving inconsistencies. Wrote SQL queries to explore business-relevant questions and uncover actionable insights. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key trends such as layoff distribution by industry and funds raised, timeline of layoffs, and layoffs by company stage.

## Summary of Findings

- The dataset covers over 250,000 layoffs across various industries globally.  
- The majority of layoffs occurred between 2022 and 2023, with a sharp peak in late 2022.
- Post-IPO and Late Stage-Venture companies contributed the highest number of layoffs.  
- Early-stage startups had fewer layoffs in terms of volume but higher as a proportion of their workforce.
- The tech sector dominated layoff numbers, with sub-sectors like consumer tech, retail tech, and fintech being heavily affected.  
- Transportation and healthcare sectors also reported noticeable layoff activity.
- Several companies with substantial funding (over $500M) still conducted large-scale layoffs, indicating that high capital doesnâ€™t necessarily safeguard against downsizing.  
- A pattern emerged where companies that raised significant rounds during 2020â€“2021 were among those laying off aggressively in 2022â€“2023.
- North America, particularly the United States, accounted for the highest layoff volume.  
- Notable spikes in layoffs were also observed in India and parts of Europe, especially among tech startups.
- The largest spike in layoffs occurred in November 2022.  
- A gradual decline is visible into mid-2023, suggesting stabilization.
- A handful of large tech companies were responsible for a disproportionate share of total layoffs (e.g., Meta, Amazon, Microsoft).
